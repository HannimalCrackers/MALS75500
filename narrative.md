****Abstract****

This project compares artificial intelligence generated content labels for a set of images against identically generated labels for reduced resolution versions of those same images.

****Introduction****

Why the NYC instagram account...


<br>

****Base dataset****

The base dataset is comprised of 387 images downloaded on March 2, 2019 from the official New York City Instagram account at https://www.instagram.com/nycgov/. To obtain the images I used a Chrome extension called "Downloader for Instagramâ„¢ (+ Upload photo)" version 5.0.70, offered by developer aboveradiant@gmail.com. 

Critique: I do not have insight into the inner workings of this plug-in. It downloaded images of varying dimensions, which is consistent with the different maximum resolutions allowed on Instagram at different times. I spot checked the dimensions of a sample of downloaded images against the dimensions listed under "Inspect Element" in the Safari browser when viewing the Instagram page and found that the "natural" dimensions listed were consistent with the dimensions of the images as downloaded.

****Fair use****

It is my belief that hosting a copy of the base Instagram image set in a zip on a GitHub repository linked to the Data TRIKE website is in accordance with fair use. The purpose of hosting the base dataset alongside the data transformations is to provide an educational example of the choices made in collecting and working with the data. Hosting these images in zip form will not divert viewers away from the @nycgov Instagram account.
