****Base dataset****

The base dataset is comprised of 387 images downloaded on March 2, 2019 from the official New York City Instagram account at https://www.instagram.com/nycgov/. To obtain the images I used a Chrome extension called "Downloader for Instagramâ„¢ (+ Upload photo)" version 5.0.70, offered by developer aboveradiant@gmail.com.

****Fair use****

It is my belief that hosting a copy of the base Instagram image set in a zip on a GitHub repository linked to the Data TRIKE website is in accordance with fair use. The purpose of hosting the base dataset alongside the data transformations is to provide an educational example of the choices made in collecting and working with the data. Hosting these images in zip form will not divert viewers away from the @nycgov Instagram account.
